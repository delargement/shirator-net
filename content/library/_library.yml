      comment: Although it gets a lot of flak for its gimmick of infusing category theory into an undergrad algebra text, I think it is successful in making an algebra text that isn't as dry nor dense as D&F and some of the other common recommendations for introductory algebra texts. I, personally, read Aluffi as my first pass through algebra and used Lang's as a reference text when returning to a topic later on.
