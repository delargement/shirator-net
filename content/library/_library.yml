      comment: I like this book a lot, teaches you a lot of the applied math that's
        good to know or one would ever need to know at the undergrad level.

      comment: I use it as reference book, since I got a physical copy through illicit
        means.

    - author: Aluffi
      comment: Initially, I was reading Dummit and Foote which ended up turning me off
        from algebra with how sterile its presentation is. But Aluffi's book hooked
        me back in with its presentation which often motivates its results. Its gimmick
        of sprinkling in category theory is pretty cool too.
